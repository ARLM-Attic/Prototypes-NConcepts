how to get rid of those annoying VSS popups:

iterate thru all the .dsp files
and remove the lines that contain this

# PROP Scc_ProjName ""$/PlatformSystems5.0/ACP/ACPHelper", SANAAAAA"
# PROP Scc_LocalPath "."

so as soon as a line contains this:
# PROP Scc_ProjName
or 
# PROP Scc_LocalPath

->delete it!!!
